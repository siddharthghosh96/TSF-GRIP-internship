# TSF-GRIP-internship
Here are the tasks I have done during my TSF GRIP internship.
Task 1 - Exploring Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the 
number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.5 hrs in a day?
